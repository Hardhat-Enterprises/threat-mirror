# Contributing to Deakin Threat Mirror
* Welcome, and thank you for considering contributing to Deakin Threat Mirror! Your contributions are essential to the success of this project. We aim to make your collaboration experience productive and straightforward. This document outlines the workflow, coding standards, and the process for submitting your contributions. 
## Step 1: Fork the Repository
Contributors should start by forking the Deakin Threat Mirror repository to their own GitHub account by clicking the Fork button.
* Go to the Deakin Threat Mirror GitHub  page.
* Click the Fork button in the top-right corner of the page to start the forking process.
Important: In the forking dialog, GitHub checks an option to "Copy the main branch only" by default.  Make sure to uncheck this option. We want to ensure you have access to the entire repository, including the Development branch, to base your contributions correctly.
## Step 2: Make Changes in the Fork
* After forking, navigate to your version of the repository in your personal git account.
* Before making any changes, switch to the *Development branch*, when using github web interface the main branch is selected by default. 
* Make the desired changes either by editing files directly on GitHub or by cloning the repository, making changes locally, and pushing them to the fork.
## Step 3: Open a Pull Request to the Development Branch
* After committing your changes, GitHub often presents a banner suggesting you create a pull request if they detect recent activity on your fork. Alternatively, you can navigate to your repository's main page where you may see a "Contribute" button.
* Click on "*Contribute*" > "*Open pull request*". GitHub will automatically guide you through the process of creating a pull request from your recent commits.
* If the "*Contribute*" button doesn't immediately show your recent changes, clicking it will still bring you to a page where you can select "Compare & pull request" next to your new branch or commits.
* Fill in the title and description for your pull request. Make sure to clearly describe the changes you're proposing.
* Once you've filled out the details, click on "Create pull request".


## Additional Tips for Contributors
Ensure your *local Development* branch (if working locally) is up to date with the *upstream Development branch* before starting your work. This minimizes merge conflicts.
