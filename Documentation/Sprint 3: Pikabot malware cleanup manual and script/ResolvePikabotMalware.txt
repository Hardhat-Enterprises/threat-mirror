# Pikabot Malware

Pikabot Malware is a type of malicious software that primarily targets networked systems. It exploits vulnerabilities to gain unauthorised access and disrupt operations.

# Architecture and Capabilities
    Pikabot's modular structure makes it easy for its controllers to customise the malware package according to their specific targets. They can add or remove functionalities as per their requirements. This unique feature of Pikabot makes it highly adaptable and harder to detect. Due to this, its signature can vary significantly between different implementations.

    One of Pikabot's core capabilities is its ability to integrate into a botnet. Each infected machine can receive commands from a central command-and-control server and can be used to carry out distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, spread further infections, or exfiltrate data. 

    Pikabot uses rootkit techniques to hide from users and antivirus software. This includes concealing files, processes, and registry keys or even intercepting and modifying system-level functions.

    Pikabot is designed with advanced security measures to ensure that network monitoring tools do not detect its communication with the C&C server. It uses sophisticated encryption methods to conceal its data exfiltration and command reception activities, making it an effective tool for carrying out tasks securely and discreetly.

# Infection Vectors
    Pikabot is often distributed via phishing emails. Furthermore, the malware spreads by exploiting known software vulnerabilities, especially in frequently used applications or operating systems that are not regularly updated.

# Detection and Mitigation
    It is recommended that your antivirus software be kept up-to-date to detect and remove Pikabot. Antivirus software that uses heuristic analysis techniques is particularly effective in detecting malware based on its behaviour rather than its signature. 

    Network-level security systems can also be configured to identify unusual patterns of network traffic that may indicate botnet activity or data exfiltration attempts. Keeping your software and operating systems updated is crucial to prevent Pikabot from exploiting known vulnerabilities. Educating users to recognise phishing attempts and avoid suspicious websites or downloads is a vital defence against many types of malware, including Pikabot.

This manual provides instructions on using a Bash script to manage Pikabot Malware infections on Linux-based systems, including detection, resolution, and preventive measures.
    Step 1. Prerequisites
            Before proceeding with the deployment of the Bash script, ensure the following conditions are met:
            •	Root Access: The script requires root privileges to modify system configurations and manage security settings.
            •	Installed Software: Ensure clamav (Clam Antivirus), ufw (Uncomplicated Firewall), and wget or curl for downloading updates are installed on your system.
    Step 2. Installations
        •	ClamAV Installation:
                sudo apt-get update
                sudo apt-get install clamav clamav-daemon -y
                sudo freshclam
        •	UFW Installation:
                sudo apt-get install ufw -y
    Step 3. Script Deployment
            The Bash script automates detection, cleaning, and securing against Pikabot Malware. Key functions include system updates, malware scanning, infected file removal, and security enhancements like firewall setup and SSH hardening.
        •	Malware Signatures Database: 
            •	The script uses a specific database file named pikabot_signatures.db. Ensure this file is updated regularly with the latest Pikabot Malware signatures.
        •	Log and Quarantine Directories: 
            •	Configure the paths according to your system's directory structure. Default paths are /var/log/pikabot-detection.log for logs and /quarantine for isolating detected malware.
    Step 4. Run the Script
            1.	Download and save the script
            2.	Make the script executable
                    chmod +x ResolvePikabot.sh
            3.	Execute Script
                    sudo ./ResolvePikabot.sh
    
   # The script performs the following operations: logs activities, updates system and antivirus databases, scans for malware, removes identified threats, and implements security measures. The script also generates detailed logs to track actions taken and verify the effectiveness.
